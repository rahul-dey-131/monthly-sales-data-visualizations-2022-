ðŸ“Š Monthly Sales Data Visualization (2022)

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This project is a straightforward and fun way to visualize monthly sales data from 2022 using Python. I took a simple CSV file full of numbers and turned it into a clear, easy-to-understand line chart with Matplotlib.

## Whatâ€™s Inside?

The notebook walks through how to load the sales data, plot it over the months, and customize the chart so it looks neat and tells a story. Itâ€™s a neat example of how a little coding can make raw data come alive!

## Tools I Used

* Python
* Pandas (to handle the data)
* Matplotlib (to create the chart)
* Jupyter Notebook (to put it all together)

## Why This Project?

If youâ€™re new to data visualization or want to see how to turn plain CSV data into something visual, this is for you. Itâ€™s also great if you want a quick demo for interviews or to add to your portfolio.

## What Youâ€™ll Learn

* How to read CSV files with Pandas
* Plotting data with Matplotlib
* Making your charts clear with labels and titles
* Highlighting key points to better understand trends

## Whatâ€™s Included?

* `plotter.ipynb` â€” the full notebook with code and comments
* `sales_data_2022.csv` â€” the raw sales data

## Try It Out!

Just run the notebook, and youâ€™ll see the sales trend from January to December. Itâ€™s simple but shows how visuals can help make sense of numbers.

> Sometimes all you need is a clean chart to see the big picture!
